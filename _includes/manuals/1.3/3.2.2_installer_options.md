The installer is a collection of Puppet modules, which have a large number of parameters available to customize the configuration.  Parameters can be set by running `foreman-installer` with arguments, e.g. `--foreman-db-type`, changing settings in interactive mode or by setting up an answers file.

The precedence for settings is for those set by arguments to foreman-installer or interactive mode, then the answers file, then the Puppet manifest defaults.

#### foreman-installer arguments

Every parameter available in the installer can be set using command line arguments to `foreman-installer`.  Run `foreman-installer --help` for a list of every available option.

When running the installer, all arguments passed on the command line will be persisted by default to /etc/foreman/foreman-installer.yaml and used automatically on subsequent runs, without needing to specify those arguments again.  This persistence can be disabled with the `-b` option.

#### Interactive mode

The installer also provides a text driven interface to customize configuration parameters, and can be run by executing:

{% highlight bash %}
foreman-installer -i
{% endhighlight %}

#### Answers file

The answers file describes the classes that will be applied to the host to
install Foreman, along with their parameters.  The foreman-installer package stores it at `/etc/foreman/foreman-installer.yaml`.  By default, the *all-in-one* setup will include Foreman, a puppetmaster, Puppet agent, and the Smart Proxy:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
foreman:
  custom_repo: true
foreman_proxy:
  custom_repo: true
puppet:
  server: true
{% endhighlight %}

Other examples are given in the next section, or `/usr/share/foreman-installer/README.md`.
