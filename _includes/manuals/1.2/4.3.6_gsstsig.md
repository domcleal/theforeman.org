Both BIND as configured in FreeIPA and Microsoft AD DNS servers can accept DNS updates using GSS-TSIG authentication.  This uses Kerberos principals to authenticate to the DNS server.  Under Microsoft AD, this is known as "Secure Dynamic Update".

#### Pre-requisites

* Kerberos principal in the realm/domain that Smart Proxy can use
* Kerberos keytab for the above principal

#### FreeIPA configuration

A service principal is required for the Smart Proxy, e.g. `host/proxy.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM`.  If the proxy is installed on the FreeIPA server, it can use the DNS principal from the host itself (e.g. `DNS/ipa.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM`).

If using a new service principal, use `ipa-getkeytab` to fetch the keytab.  If using FreeIPA's existing DNS keytab, it's important to copy the existing one from `/etc/named.keytab` as requesting a new one will cause the serial number to increment and the existing one to be invalid.

Copy the keytab to `/etc/foreman-proxy/dns.keytab` and ensure permissions are 0600 and the owner is `foreman-proxy`.

The ACL on updates to the DNS zone then needs to permit the service principal.  In the FreeIPA web UI, under the DNS zone, go to the Settings tab and add to the BIND update policy a new grant:

    grant DNS\047ipa.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM wildcard * ANY;

Note the `\047` is written verbatim, and don't forget the semicolon.

#### Proxy configuration

Next, update the proxy configuration file (`/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml`) with the following settings:

    :dns_provider: nssupdate_gss
    :dns_tsig_keytab: /etc/foreman-proxy/dns.keytab
    :dns_tsig_principal: DNS/ipa.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
