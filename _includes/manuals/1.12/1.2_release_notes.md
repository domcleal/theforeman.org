### Upgrade warnings

### Deprecations
*

The following deprecations may affect API users, plugin authors or advanced users.

* ENC/Puppet users of the `domainname` parameter should be aware this is now the
  name, not description.
* ENC/Puppet users of the `location`/`organization` parameters should be aware
  they are now the full titles, not short names.
* API host responses containing `hostgroup_name` now contains the short name,
  and `hostgroup_title` contains the fully-qualified name with any parents.
* Plugin authors with DB migrations containing `foreign_keys` should use
  `foreign_key_exists?` instead.
